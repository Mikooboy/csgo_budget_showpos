## ðŸ›  Tool to display your current position and angle above your radar.

As a response to the CS:GO Update on 1.2.2022, which makes `cl_showpos` a cheat-protected command, I have made a simple tool to display your position and angle in game.

* **This will not get you VAC banned 100% as it does not hook into the game in any sort of way.**

## âŒ¨ Controls

* You can stop and resume the script by writing `!showpos` to the csgo console.

* You can also bind this to a key for easier access: `bind <key> "echo !showpos"`

## ðŸ’¾ Installation and setup

Add the following to the CS:GO launch options:

    -netconport 2121
    
Install [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/): 

    https://www.python.org/downloads/
    
Clone and run the program:

    git clone https://github.com/Mikooboy/csgo_budget_showpos
    cd csgo_budget_showpos
    python main.py

Have fun!
