**!!! This tool no longer works !!!**

**If you find a way to get the position in the console somehow please let me know!**

## ðŸ›  Tool to display your current position and angle above your radar.

As a response to the CS:GO Update on 1.2.2022, which makes `cl_showpos` a cheat-protected command, I have made a simple tool to display your position and angle in game.

* **This will not get you VAC banned 100% as it does not hook into the game in any sort of way.**

* **Update** 17.2.2022: Valve has now cheat-protected `getpos` and `getpos_exact`. Tool now uses `spec_pos` which still works but the values are rounded to a single decimal.

* **Update** 19.2.2022: Valve disabled `developer 1` on their servers so we can no longer print the info at the top left of the game. Printing is now done to the terminal.

## âŒ¨ Controls

* You can stop and resume the script by writing `!showpos` to the csgo console.

* You can also bind this to a key for easier access: `bind <key> "echo !showpos"`
